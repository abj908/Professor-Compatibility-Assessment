# Professor-Compatibility-Assessment

There are many websites available for students to assess potential professors traits, reviews, and ratings prior to course registration. However, these platforms don't provide a methodology for students to assess their compatibility with a given professor. Our Professor Compatibility Assessment allows students to get matched with a professor based on data from professor rating sites and user preferences. In this project, we share a methodology that is user tested and statistically validated, and is created with the intent of improving long term academic success among students.
