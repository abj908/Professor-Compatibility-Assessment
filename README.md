# Professor-Compatibility-Assessment

There are many websites available for students to assess potential professors traits, reviews, and ratings prior to course registration. However, these platforms don't provide a methodology for students to assess their compatibility with a given professor. Our Professor Compatibility Assessment allows students to get matched with a professor based on data from professor rating sites and user preferences. In this project, we share a methodology that is user tested and statistically validated, and is created with the intent of improving long term academic success among students. Google forms, Google Sheets, and JavaScript were used on this project
